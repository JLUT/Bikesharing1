**Project Overview**

In this module, we worked with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company.And in this challenge, we put together our final presentation and analysis for investors. We selected the questions we wanted to answer, conducted independent research, crafted our story in Tableau, and then created our written analysis.

Objectives

   . Import data into Tableau.
   .Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
   .Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
   . Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.
   
   
 Import data into Tableau
  
In Tableau, we have a variety of different options when it comes to data sources. We can have flat files such as CSV, PDF, and TXT files, as well as other data sources like databases and data streams. (These will mostly be SQL databases.)

There are two primary ways that Tableau connects to the data we provide: through live data or extract data. Both have their benefits and uses:

Live data is primarily databases such as MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server. Live data is just what it sounds like: live data. This type of data is updated every time we view the dashboard, since it’s possible that the data has changed in our database.

Extract data is primarily when we use files such as CSV, TXT, or PDF. These files remain unchanged unless we pull a new extract of the data. For example, if we update the file, we would have to update it in Tableau as well. For our analysis, we imported the CSV file, which contains all the data we needed for this project. Therefore, we technically worked with extracted data for our project.

Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.

The best visualizations have a clear purpose and work for their intended audience. What will we be trying to say with this dashboard? Are we presenting a conclusion or a key question?

In addition to knowing what we're trying to say, it's important to know who we're saying it to. Does our audience know this subject matter extremely well or will it be new to them? What kind of cues will they need? Thinking about these questions before we head into the design phase can help us create a successful dashboard.

Designing data visualizations is a huge field within the data industry, with some jobs devoted to making visualizations look better. While we don’t need to know everything about designing worksheets, we should be familiar with some best practices. The Tableau website provides information about best practices for effective dashboards.

**Results**


Display data professionally and accurately.
Professionally style a Tableau story.
Utilize previously created Tableau worksheets to create a new story.
Create a Tableau story based on starting a bike-sharing company in Des Moines.




**Challenge Summary**

For this portion of the presentation, we worked with a team that is trying to answer core questions about opening a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.

Our goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we wanted to format our story so it was persuasive. We also wanted to include information about both New York City and Des Moines—after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.

 And I created two additional visualizations also.
